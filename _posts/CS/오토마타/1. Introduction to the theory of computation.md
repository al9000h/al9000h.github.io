# 0. preface
## 1. prerequisities
1. 고급 프로그래밍 언어 지식(C, C++, Java)
2. 자료구조 & 알고리즘 기초
3. 이산수학(set theory, functions, relations, logic, mathematical reasoning)
## 2. purpose
1. principles of CS
2. materials that is useful in subsequent courses
3. ability to carry out formal and rigorous mathematical arguments
> mathematical skill  
!= byproduct of reading someone else's arguments  
== come from  
<1> thinking about essence of a problem  
<2> discovering ideas suitable to make a point  
<3> carrying them out in precise detail
## 3. problem solving approach
- exercise
1) simple: picking up where the discussion in the text leaves off && asking to carry on for another step or two
2) difficult: challenging

# 1. Introduction to the theory of computation
- subject matter
  1) automata theory
  2) formal languages and grammar
  3) computability
  4) complexity
- various automata -> related to language, grammars, what can/can't be done by digital computer
- why study theory?
  1) theory's concept & principle -> understanding the general nature of the discipline(machine design ~ programming)
  2) the idea -> immediate and important application
  3) subject matter is intellectualyy stimulating and fun
- models
  1) automata
    - accepts input
    - produces output
    - some temporary storage
    - make decision: transforming input to output
  2) formal language: general characteristics of programming language
    - set of symbols
    - some rules of formation: symbols can be combined into entity(=sentence)
    - formal language = set of all sentences
  3) algorithm
